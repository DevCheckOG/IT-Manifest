# Artificial Intelligence

## The Problem

The rise of artificial intelligence brought with it additional problems, including the overexploitation of content, the rise of generic mediocrity, phantom tools, and one-time utilities. With the standardization of its widespread use, we are falling into the dead internet, although I would also call it uncreative humanity.

## Sources 

As has been repeated, there are many reasons why artificial intelligence is promoting its generic use, fostering the development of a flat mind with flat dreams in a world where the majority has the same mindset.

Among those responsible for this are content creators, people deeply involved in artificial intelligence and the rise of AI startups. At the same time, the widespread availability of this content is widespread.

## My Criteria

Either way, we're on the verge of AI breaking down. It's already known that it's suffering from a significant slowdown in its development. In addition to the red flags, such as leading AI companies seeking money more aggressively than ever.

All this is thanks to the wonder that is the human brain and how its complete understanding will always be impossible for humans themselves and how its logic cannot be abstracted into mathematics and code.

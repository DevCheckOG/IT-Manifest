# Incompetence, the loss of curiosity, and the oversaturation

## The Problem

There's a major problem with the arrival of new juniors into the market in the approach to programmers. 

One of those problems is due to the oversaturation of these, the massification of bootcamps, and their sheer salesmanship. 

And as juniors increasingly fail to stand out and resign themselves to working on generic projects at astronomical rates, they are, according to the recruiter's criteria, a perfect "candidate", which is reflected in a __**lack of talent**__ and a trait of pure human automation. As if humans were robots.

## Sources 

Many of the sources of these problems go beyond programming, education, its extreme automation, the system, the leap of stupidity of people, factory ineptitude, influence by the world that surrounds us, the rarity of the intelligent, and the rise of irrelevant things in entertainment.

Other sources come from social, economic, and racial areas, which, through influence on the educational and political system, lead to a disastrous future development of engineering candidates.

Much of the blame lies with the content we consume and its automation, resulting in a decline in quality. This highlights people's lack of curiosity and ambition, keeping their brains "busy" with junk content.

## My Criteria

### Programming Criteria

This is where I always say you shouldn't do community projects, but always within your capabilities. A good project requires continuous development and, above all, dedication and time. A to-do app, like the example on GitHub, isn't a good example.

### Life Criteria

This applies to life in general. In my opinion, if you have the opportunity to excel in some __**USEFUL**__ field with a view to adulthood, do it. Just do it. Don't be stupid; don't waste time. Life, at least on earth, is only for now.

Don't do common things; go crazy. Everything is once. Always do it the best way.

Be persistent and resilient, because you will encounter brains trapped in a common and generic development.

But always be respectful to those types of people; you don't know why they are trapped in that development. Never judge without knowing ANYTHING in life.

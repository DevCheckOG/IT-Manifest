# Tech Jobs

## The Problem

There's currently a mess in the tech job world. There are a lot of newbies and absurd requirements for every job, not to mention the fact that they're paid much less than they should be.

It's understood that many of the reasons why job postings have excessive requirements are that there are not enough people to fill a senior position in a certain position.

But here's the problem. At the same time they engage in this terrible and despicable practice, they indoctrinate newbies to follow a path to achieve success and enter their positions. This is a false wall, a lie concealed by the curtain of a job. This leaves beginners somewhat to blame for not being able to identify these problems that tech instruction has been accumulating for so long.

This leads to beginners feeling incapable of achieving a job in a particular way. This is a cancer, but unfortunately, like many types of cancer, it is very difficult to remove.

This also contributes to the development of conceited and narcissistic individuals. Those who are already employed by a certain company feel untouchable, but they must remember that the company always considers you replaceable, especially if you're not a talented individual. And that must hurt, but that's what comes from having a flat mindset from childhood.

## Sources

The main cause of these problems is often the recruiter's lack of applicable computer skills in the field in which they are offering the position. In addition to this gap, it's also due to the problem of being practically slaves: they do more, they pay less. 

This is partly due to "headhunting" companies, which aren't really headhunters; they are more like "needs-based headhunters," seeking highly skilled developers with far below-average requirements. While this is a skill, no one should be undervalued.

## My Criteria

My criteria for this problem are just to be patient and keep moving forward. There are things that don't have a quick fix, but to give yourself more opportunities, go crazy and do incredible things, innovate, and keep moving forward. Everyone will eventually achieve fulfillment.
